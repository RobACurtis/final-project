# surfr-photographer

#### A web application for surf photographers who want to showcase their photographs to the world. 

I built this full stack, single page application out of my love for coding and my love for surfing. I used to be a very active photographer, and I was a regular visitor to flickr.com. I wanted to take on the challenge to replicate flickr's design and layout as well as put my own spin on it, and make an application exclusively for surf photographers.

5. Start postgreSQL.

  ```shell
sudo service postgresql start
  ```
6. Check if postgreSQL is running.
    
```shell
sudo service postgresql status
